# Second Opinion

**Understand your health. Not just your diagnosis.**

An AI-powered health literacy companion that helps you understand lab results, track biomarkers, check medication interactions, and prepare for doctor visits.

> Second Opinion is an educational tool — not a medical device. Always consult your healthcare provider.

## This repo (waitlist landing)

Single landing page with email waitlist. Emails are stored in Supabase; duplicate submissions are rejected; the API is rate-limited (5 requests/min per IP) to reduce abuse.

### Supabase free tier

On the **free plan you are not charged** if traffic or usage spikes. You have fixed limits (e.g. database size, API requests); if you hit them, the project may be paused or throttled until the next period—you do **not** get a surprise bill. Bots or spam will hit the app’s rate limit first, then Supabase’s own limits, not your credit card. For details see [Supabase pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing).
